<b>News:  As Google has disabled the ability to provide binary downloads here, and as I want to do a release of CSVfix 1.6 in the not too distant future, I'm in the process of moving this site to Bitbucket. The source code and the manual are already <a href='http://neilb.bitbucket.org/csvfix'>there</a>, and I hope to transfer all other content in the next few days (neilb, 12/04/2014)</b>

<b>News: CSVFix 1.6 is now released and available at <a href='http://neilb.bitbucket.org/csvfix'>BitBucket</a>. Issues are now being tracked in the issue tracker there. Please download from there rather than from this site,</b>

<h3>The Problem</h3>
If you have any dealings at all with data and databases,<br>
then you almost certainly will have have to deal with<br>
comma-separated values (CSV) data. Unfortunately, the CSV<br>
files you are given, or are required to produce, never seem<br>
to be in quite the right format for your particular business<br>
application. And because of the structure of CSV records, using<br>
standard text processing tools like sed, awk and perl on CSV files is not<br>
as simple as it might be.<br>
<br>
<h3>The Solution</h3>
<b>CSVfix</b> is a command-line tool specifically<br>
designed to deal with CSV data. With it you can, among other things:<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Reorder, remove, split and merge fields</li>
<li>Convert case, trim leading & trailing spaces</li>
<li>Search for specific content using regular expressions</li>
<li>Filter out duplicate data or data on exclusion lists</li>
<li>Enrich with data from other sources</li>
<li>Add sequence numbers and file source information</li>
<li>Split large CSV files into smaller files based on field contents</li>
<li>Perform arithmetic calculations on individual fields</li>
<li>Validate CSV data against a collection of validation rules</li>
<li>Convert  between CSV and fixed format, XML, SQL and DSV</li>
</ul>

The CSVfix manual, detailing all commands, is <a href='http://csvfix.byethost5.com/csvfix15/csvfix.html'>here</a>.
